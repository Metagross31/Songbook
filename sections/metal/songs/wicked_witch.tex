\beginverse
\[C]There is a \[G]demon, an \[Am]evil mind inside us.
\[C]Oh I \[G]know, I \[Am]know.
We all know the \[F]rules when water will be \[G]shed.
The wicked witch isâ€¦
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[C]This is the \[G]end of all the \[Am]miracles.
\[C]Farewell to \[G]you yellow brick \[Am]road.
\[F]Everything she is \[G]asking for, it \[Am]all belongs to her
\[F]Now she's gone into \[G]nothingness there she \[Am]waits
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[C]Still I can \[G]hear her singing \[Am]in the room,
In the \[C]room,
I \[G]know she's \[Am]gone
I've thought She'll never \[F]fail,
Her magic will be \[G]gone,
the day she'll melt \[C]away.
\endverse
\beginchorus
This is the \[G]end of all the \[Am]miracles.
 (Still i hear her singing in the dark)
\[C]Farewell to \[G]you yellow brick \[Am]road.
 (Truth has changed, her voice it stays the same)
As \[F]time goes on her \[G]voice will fade \[Am]away.
\[F]They are all, they're \[G]everything, they are \[Am]mine
Silver shoes you're \[F]mine, you are \[G]mine,
You are \[Am]mine.
 (Hate will live on)
\[F]This is the \[G]end of all the \[Am]miracles.
 (Hate will live on)
\[F]Farewell to \[G]you yellow brick \[Am]road.
 (Hate will live on)

\[F]The \[G]wicked witch is \[Am]dead.
